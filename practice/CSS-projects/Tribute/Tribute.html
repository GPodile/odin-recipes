            <p>
                Meyiwa was a goalkeeper for <strong>Orlando Pirates</strong> from <strong><em>2005</em></strong> as reserve goalkeeper to <strong>Francis Chansa</strong> until <strong><em>2008</em></strong>.The arrival of new coach <strong>Milutin Sredojević</strong> at Pirates gave Meyiwa a debut against <strong><em>AmaZulu</em></strong> in a league match won <strong>2–1</strong> by The Bucs at <strong>Ellis Park</strong> on <strong><em>8 November 2006</em></strong>. But in <strong><em>2008</em></strong> when he was about to show his talent after depture of <strong>Francis Chansa</strong> to <strong>Engen Santos</strong>, <strong>Pirates</strong> brought <strong>Moeneeb Josephs</strong> from <strong>Wits University</strong> in <em>2008</em> and Meyiwa again had to be goalkeeper from the bench. But in 2012 season the interim coach <strong>Augusto Palacios</strong> gave Meyiwa some games by swiping him with Josephs, and the new coach of Pirates <strong>Roger De Sa</strong> gave Meyiwa a chance due to Josephs shoulder injury in 2012 season. Meyiwa showed his talent until he was picked for <strong>2013 Africa Cup of Nations</strong> by then <strong>Bafana Bafana</strong> coach <strong>Gordon Igesund</strong>. Josephs wanted to leave Pirates in 2013 and he left Pirates to Bidvest Wits after seeing that he has no chance to play. Pirates brought Ghanaian first choice goalkeeper <strong>Fatau Dauda</strong> in <em>2013</em> season but Meyiwa continued to play and Dauda played only 3 games for Pirates and he left to Chippa United in 2014. <strong>Meyiwa is known for saving penalties in the Champions League 2013 against TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi</strong>, <strong>DRC</strong> when he saved two awarded penalties against Pirates which were both taken by then <strong>TP Mazembe captain Tresor Mputu</strong> and Pirates' then captain <strong>Lucky Lekgwathi</strong> was red carded in that match that which Pirates lost by 1-0 but Pirates won there by aggregate of 3–2, Meyiwa also saved another penalty in group stage match against <strong>Al Ahly</strong> in <strong>Cairo</strong>, <strong>Egypt</strong> that which was taken by <strong>Mohamed Aboutrika</strong> and Pirates won by <em>3–0</em>, and Meyiwa also helped Pirates to go to the final against <strong>Al Ahly</strong> where Pirates were runners-up in the Final. Meyiwa was backed up by <strong>Brighton Mhlongo</strong> until his final kick of his game life in his final game against <strong>Ajax Cape Town F.C</strong>. in <strong>2014 Telkom Knockout Quarter-final</strong> victory of <em>4–1</em> at Orlando Stadium on Saturday 25 October 2014, before his death on <strong>26 October 2014 Sunday</strong>.

For the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, he played four times, with his last match being a 0–0 draw against Congo on 15 October 2014 at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. <br>
                <br>
                He was given a captain's armband in all of his last four games that which he played in 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualification and he joined Brian Baloyi and Moeneeb Josephs by being the only goalkeepers who captained Bafana in four occasions each without conceding a goal during their captaincy, with two draws and two wins each of them. He earned a total of seven international caps with six clean sheets.

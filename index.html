                    A calzone is a savory Italian turnover. It traditionally consists of a cheesy filling in a leavened dough and is served with marinara sauce on the side. The calzone originated in Naples in the 18th-century. Calzones have Italian origins and are sealed with a fork. The sauce is traditionally served on the side.

                    A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese. A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.

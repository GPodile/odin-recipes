            <p>
                A calzone is a savory Italian turnover. It traditionally consists of a cheesy filling in a leavened dough and is served with marinara sauce on the side. The calzone originated in Naples in the 18th-century. Calzones have Italian origins and are sealed with a fork. The sauce is traditionally served on the side.

        <h3 class="title">Step To Prepare The Real Italian Calzones</h3>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl; let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth. Gradually stir in remaining flour until dough is smooth and workable.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until it is elastic, about 5 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl; lay dough in the bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine Cheddar cheese, ricotta cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and basil leaves in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate to chill.

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Punch down dough; divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece out on a lightly floured surface into 1/8-inch-thick circles. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese and meat filling.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Step 6</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fold dough over filling to make a semicircle. Press edges down with the tines of a fork to seal. Brush the top of each calzone with beaten egg and place on the prepared baking sheet.

                <ul>
                    <li>
